FAUST-STK PROJECT

WHAT IS IT?

This project aims to implement the instruments and some audio effects from the Synthesis Tool Kit (STK) in the FAUST programming language. The Synthesis Tool Kit is a set of open source audio signal processing and algorithmic synthesis classes written in the C++ programming language. Faust AUdio STreams is a functional programming language for realtime audio signal processing developed at GRAME in Lyon (France). The Faust compiler translates DSP specifications into efficient C++ code. 

This work is being conducted at Stanford University CCRMA (Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics) and Jean-Monnet university (Saint-Etienne, France) CIEREC (Centre Interdisciplinaire d'Etude et de Recherche sur l'Expression Contemporaine) in the frame of the ASTREE project (Analyse et Synthèse de Traitement Temps Réel, ANR-08-CORD-003).      
The instruments will be documented using the Faust automatic documentation generator. Another goal of this project is to create a set of C++ functions to load parameters texts files and wave files in Faust in order to use any kind of raw datas for tables lookups. Inputing parameters texts files in Faust will make it possible to handle important number of datas requiered for some synthesis algorithms such as modal synthesis.  The current package (01/19/2011) contains the following instruments:	-	bowed.dsp: A bowed string instrument physical model using WaveGuide synthesis.	-	brass.dsp: A brass instrument physical model using WaveGuide synthesis.	-	clarinet.dsp: A simple clarinet physical model using WaveGuide synthesis.	-	flute.dsp: A flute physical model using WaveGuide synthesis.	-	flutestk.dsp: A simple flute physical model based on the STK algorithm and using WaveGuide synthesis.	-	glassHarmonica.dsp: A banded WaveGuide modeled glass instrument.	-	saxophony.dsp: A simple saxophone physical model using WaveGuide synthesis.	-	tibetanBowl.dsp: A banded WaveGuide modeled Tibetan Bowl.	-	tundeBar.dsp: A banded WaveGuide modeled Tuned Bar.	-	uniBar.dsp: A banded WaveGuide modeled uniform Bar.

COMPILING THE FAUST CODES

The Faust codes in this package have been tested in puredata and jackqt architecture:make			compiles all the Faust codes in Pure Data plug-ins.make jackqt		compiles all the Faust codes in Qt applications using jack-audio.
